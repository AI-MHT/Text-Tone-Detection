# Text-Tone-Detection
This project demonstrates a simple text classification model using TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained to classify comments into different categories (tonalities) based on the provided dataset. The script preprocesses the text data, builds a neural network with Keras, and trains the model on the dataset.
